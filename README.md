Changes that i make is i add sidebar and move the dark-mode and profile into it (Navigation Pattern) in the page which make the user become easier to access menu in the login page that is good for complex dashboards or apps with many sections because itallows vertical scanning and grouping.
The design pattern that i already use are in the input & form patterns (Labels vs Placeholder) my design is utilizing the placeholder text within the input fields to indicate the purpose of each field, first field is the username or the email and the second one is the password.
The third design pattern that i already use is the data presentation patterns which i hide the personal user account detail into a button and not present the data right away at the login page. 
In the email and password placeholder also i already apply the feedback & status patterns which the page will give some sort of feedback when the user click the login but have not fill the email or either the password (<img width="1901" height="839" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53d637e5-d6cd-4497-8fd3-15ea71c571c2" />)

After Apply design patterns:
Input and Form (Placeholder for email and password): <img width="1053" height="520" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2faf7b89-1c4d-4df2-b53a-f881b60e84df" />
Navigation Pattern (Sidebar for home and profile): <img width="495" height="540" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85001de5-3b5f-4fdf-937b-b77889074bcf" />
Feedback and Status pattern (user need to fill in both email and password before click login button): <img width="1106" height="529" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6a7ffc8-d14b-41d7-ae85-ecdd0fc018cd" />
Layout & Structure pattern (Responsive design for phone, tablet, and laptop): <img width="947" height="799" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/568be761-a734-45a4-85be-5b703abad182" />
Data presentation: Hide the profile detail into a button inside sidebar <img width="391" height="317" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f7a6f4f-ec90-403f-9ceb-6932b8ff5e5f" />
Pattern that i use:
First is the input and form which is the placeholder which make the user become easier to access menu in the login page that is good for complex dashboards or apps with many sections because itallows vertical scanning and grouping.
Second is the navigation pattern which is the sidebar that contain home and profile, when apply the sidebar it will make my page look more clean and simple to the user that hide the personal user account detail into a button and not present the data right away at the login page. 
Third is the Feedback and status pattern so user know that user cannot click login before fill in the detail like email and password.
The expected result on the user is ofcourse to improve the user experience when they are accesing my webpage cause it looks clean and simple, and they feel the sense of easy to use in my webpage.
Those can fit my own features because my features is needed a lot of organizing element so those pattern fit in my own features.
